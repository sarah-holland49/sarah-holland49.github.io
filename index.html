        <p>Welcome to my first website! I am currently taking my first class on web development, so my skills aren't the best yet. I mostly understand how to use html code because I've already taken several classes for other programming lanuages like Python and Java, but I'm kind of struggling with the CSS. Not to mention, I'm no artist and my organization skills are a bit lacking.</p>
        <p>But anyways! Thanks for viewing my first website!</p>
